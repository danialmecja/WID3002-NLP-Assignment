He listens to my concerns and pains, and I think that's how a psychiatrist should be to have an accurate diagnosis. I have taken the new medication he prescribed, and I find that the medicines help me with little or no downside. Dr.Jeya's clinic may not be fully furnished, but it's well cleaned. The only con is that he always seems not available in the afternoon after 12pm, nurses claimed that he is visiting other patients outside the clinic.

Further updates after 3 visits:
I have IED + depression, the medicine given to me by my previous psychiatrist other than being costly, they does not help but in fact giving side effects. So, I have Dr.Jeya to re-diagnose my illness, and after 6 weeks of taking the medicine prescribed by him, I am alive again. I managed to have my life back on track, myself & my family is so greatful to have  Dr.Jeya as my psychiatrist.

From my personal experience that have took me a year to find out, if you are having doubts about your existing psychiatrist or medicine, it's better to have another psychiatrist to re-diagnose your case.

Dr.Jeya's charges are so friendly that seeing a psychiatrist is no longer available for the rich only."

Contrary to existing reviews, I do appreciate Dr Lim's candor. Very straightforward but with a handful of empathy.

While I consider continuing to seek treatment from Dr Lim, the overall experience leaves much to be desired. The 2nd review accompanied by my bf (requested by Dr Lim) to assist the diagnosis felt extremely rushed, juxtaposed to the 45mins long 1st consultation my mom sat in for. I was oblivious that the duration for all subsequent visits are 15 mins sessions, which we found out after I unknowingly paid for an overrun.

The experience could be improved if the receptionist were to inform me of every item charged for the clinic visit. I was verbally informed of the review (15mins session) fee + medication, but not the additional 1/2 block (+$50) for an overrun that was charged. The full itemised bill came as a rude shock after payment was made.

Though the receptionist was quick to explain the charges when enquired, provision of information of charges before the session begins would really help avoid minor inconsistencies in service that stresses patients. It could have been avoided with a more meticulous rundown on the sessions and charges.

I would still consider my overall experience at Dr Lim's clinic a positive one based on the 1st consultation despite this really unpleasant incident on my 2nd visit."

I went to see Dr Lim last year as his name was the first that came up in the google search results.
During the session, he diagnosed me with adjustment disorder.
Upon further questions about my diagnosis, he actually questioned my reason for visiting him. He very not empathetic throughout the session and he was also trying to implying that I was FAKING my illness.
Honestly, I do not think anyone with a logical mind would pay $200-$300+ and travel all the way down to your clinic just to pretend to be ""ill""?
My family was outraged by the cold and unempathetic attitude.
We never went back and subsequently I found very caring doctors who genuinely cared me and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, medicine was given as well.
Lesson learnt is not to choose the first doctor you see on search results and read all reviews before visiting!
Can you imagine a patient who was at their lowest and decided to seek help but was treated like this?
Very bad experience. Don't even deserve a star.
We will definitely not visit this clinic again. We also do not recommend this clinic to those seeking for hope in troubled times of illness."

Before having these issues, I‚Äôve been lacking focus in my life for many years. Until I seek helps from Dr. Lim this April, I was diagnosed with mild depression. I am glad to visit him early, otherwise I don‚Äôt think I am still surviving because I have suicidal thoughts when I couldn‚Äôt sleep for weeks coupling with severe anxiety disorder. After taking the medicines prescribed, although the first few weeks were rough with side effects, I felt better after the adjustment period. The medicines did its job to reduce the obsessive side of my depression and remove my constant invasive terrible thoughts. I am much more sociable, confident and pretty much getting my life back on track now. If you‚Äôre not feeling ok and need immediate assistance, I highly recommend Dr. Lim rather than going to polyclinic, get referral to see psychiatrists in general hospitals because the waiting time is super long. This is to prevent tragedy from happening because mental illness is something that cannot be ignored/neglected. It will directly affect our physical health."

I got her name registered and told nurses at clinic at 8th floor that I will bring my mum at 10.25am . This is because of my mum is very old and afraid of interaction with people when crowded. I came and doctor went for rounds. Told to wait 1hour. No courtesy to call and inform and then she had to wait for doctor to come in only can do blood test. I said we don't want to find and while doctor is away we can do blood check. We cams back at Conic at 11.30am waited for doctor and other patients went in.  When asked an hour later the nurse said have to wait for blood test before seeing doctor. What rubbish. Clearly if the normal nurse for clinic around it won't happen. Nurse went for leave for wedding. I think it's just pure poor management.  This is my worst experience in this hospital. The doctor is the best in the hospital I got no complaints but compliments.

What kind of doctor will say this to someone who is going through such a bad thing. Yes , his medications work of course , but while this doctor knows what he does and can give you some medication plans , he is not an ""empathetic"" and kind doctor. That is why I am giving 2 stars. I hope if you are reading this doctor , you will learn to work on the way you treat you patients , although I still thankful for helping to save me."

After running without clothes on for 12 min and sweating heavily, there was no towel given.. and it was in an aircon room..Although appointment was made a week before, we were told to postpone the ultrasound to 12pm because there was no radiologist available. due to fasting too long, especially for my mum and mum in law, whom are elderly, we decided to change the ultrasound appointment to 2 days later.
When we arrived early 2 days later for ultrasound, we were made to wait for almost an hour! After numerous checking with the registration counter, she said it was not her problem because there were 3 patients inside and we still need to WAIT although our appointment time has passed!!!
This is unacceptable because we are paying customers and this is not the expected service by a private hospital. There were only a handful of nurses around and i can see that they could not cope with the tests.
Worse still, when we finally made our way to the imaging department, the staff inside mentioned she was waiting for our arrival since 8:30am, and we were made to WAIT and WAIT outside at the registration counter!! Why is there no communication??!!!üò°üò°üò°"

So what's the point of the diagnosis?

Went to another private Dr after that and she rolled her eyes saying that Dr Ang should exclude ADD/ADHD first before settling on BPD. Wasted my time and money on a rude and inompetent doctor with no bedside manners. Dr Ang is very keen to prescribe medications but not follow through with therapy and counselling. Don't recommend unless you want to feel more upset, waste your time/money and risk medication dependency."

When dr ang asked if i had any history of suicide, before I could reply him, he already went and said ""I guess not"" and continue on talking for the remainder of the session without giving me a chance to correct his assumption. After that, I am no longer sure I was able to trust him to help in my recovery. I guess it was because I mentioned to him that i was reading self help books and he just assumed I was doing well. However it is because reading was not helping at all that i went to see a doctor. If your definition of therapy is to listen to a doctor talk, then I highly recommend dr ang. He likes to talk, a lot in fact, to the point where he's just the one talking. I'm not sure if the session is about me if I'm not able to have any inputs. I wish that effectiveness was measured by its cost, then it would be easiest to just choose the most expensive. But if it is not effective, am I supposed to continue paying despite not receiving results. To be fair, a lot of people have mentioned benefitting from him but that honestly was not the experience that I had, and a review is to discuss your experiences, @maxneo not to judge and assume other people experiences for them especially when you were not present there."

Unfortunately he didn‚Äôt help my condition, during his treatment I encountered more problems. Consultation fee is roughly SGD 800 / hour thus you‚Äôre paying premium rates. On average you‚Äôll have to wait 1 hour from your time of appointment as he‚Äôs usually late or schedules too many appointments per day. Past reviews are correct, you‚Äôll spend most of your time listening rather than discussing issues. There‚Äôs a lot of repetition, Dr Ang likes to repeat himself which gets tiring and frustrating. Key take away is that he‚Äôs a Psychiatrist, thus prescribing medication is what he does. Dr Ang is a nice person but his methods I question."

My brother and I brought my mom to the emergency after she complained about stomach pain. We went to a private clinic (the doctor suggested my mom to get herself checked in a bigger facility -- we think the hospital, of course!), and then to HSA's polyclinic few days back, but her conditions worsen since then.

At the emergency, her BP, temperature, etc was checked, and the officer (not sure whether he was a Doctor) said that my mom's vital is fine, and she can go home, without even checking her stomach! My brother who is a veterinarian insisted that my mom be given more thorough checks, then in the midst of all that, a senior doctor came by and asked about my mother's condition.

Some more checks were done, and my mom was asked to stay in the emergency ward for few more hours until the results came back.

Despite all those checks, my mom was discharged a few hours later and was given a date for a follow-up appointment which will occur a few months later.

My mother was a civil servant, and she did not take up any medical cards or insurance coverage, trusting that the public health service was enough. So my brother and I decided to pool our savings and send my mom to a private facility the very next day. After spending some five-figures money for an endoscopy and three-night stay in the private ward, true enough, her stomach pain was not just bad food and gases. She had level 2 lymphoma, cancer! With the diagnosis, we got her admitted into another  public hospital immediately.

Imagine if we trusted and waited for the follow-up appointment given by the doctor at HSI."

The nurse in the emergency department was cold , rude and unwilling to check my grandma thoroughly due the fact that I missed an appointment? I was utterly shocked by the treatment I received from this hospital and they even suggested me to go to KMC , reason being that the machine broke down? Or was it because of personal feud against me?

But what I observed was, the dept did not look like an emergency dept as it was so slow and inefficient. It looks like they short of staffs or something not sure but everytime I went to the dept whether to collect my medicines or just accompanying my relatives, it is always need to wait quite sometimes *roll eyes*. I suggest KPJ Perlis to open another counter for registration instead of cramming registration and prescriptions in one counter after working hour. And also probably hire more staffs that can handle a number of cases in an efficient way. I believe, number of patients are increasing day by day. However, the good side, my experience being warded there previously, the nurses were all very supportive and very positive. Nurses are hands down, really patient and assisted me in so many areas until I was discharged. There are rooms for improvement. Hope they can do better in the future."

My wife brought our 2 childrens to KMC on 14/04/2022 around 9pm. Since both are symptomatic, RTK test had to be done first. Yeah, my daughter is positive after a very long wait.

1st failed service : RTK test that took more than 1 hour to do and get result (a small clinic at pekan kepala batas, Alor Setar can do a better, super fast RTK test and result).

2nd failed service : very very poor communication to a customer/patient on what to do and what to expect on the service flow. No clear direction and procedure, at least to those working on 14/04 evening.

3rd failed service : KMC is a private hospital. We were being told that not enough doctor to handle patient at that time. How come???

We finally managed to settle everything close to 1am, 15th April 2022.

Why? Firstly, location. I live nearby and I almost nearly never have to wait in any line. SOP is strictly followed and DR. Ahmad is amazing!

I feel that they are able to assist you with almost all your complications. Best part is that, if they aren't equipped to, they will go out of their way to offer solutions, recommend contacts just to help you out.

Their team is driven, and I must thank Mohammad, for all his help. Never failing to attend to the community of Langkawi, as they are always on standby to aid.

If you're on the island, and have experience falling ill, food poisoning, gastric, or of any kind of illness, I would suggest you to head to this clinic to get yourself checked first.

It is located inside the vicinity of Pelangi Beach Resort, Langkawi.

Dr. Stephen was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, experienced, and he assured me that the challenges I was going through were nothing to be ashamed of. As mentioned in the website, my first session with Dr. Stephen, he did a complete psychiatric evaluation. With the stigma of mental health in Malaysia, I was nervous going in, but by the end Dr. Stephen created a safe space where I was comfortable and accepting of my problems, and more importantly, aware that I can change them with treatment. He patiently discussed my issues and explained to me whatever I couldn‚Äôt understand or had trouble realising.

I highly recommend this place and Dr. Stephen if you‚Äôre looking for a psychiatrist who actively listens and helps the patient.

One is Doctor Au Yong and another is Doctor Francis Lau. Both are very experienced psychiatrists. It's a private clinic, none government funded clinic. And also is a Psychiatrist professional clinic, not a Psychology clinic. There's a big difference between a psychiatrist and psychologist. Psychiatrist is a doctor that specializes in treating mental health issues such like insomnia, depression, or worst case scenario like people who had total mental breakdown perhaps suffered from a terrible tragedy or disaster before. Whereas a Psychologist doctor specializes in treating people who have suffered from mental discouragements and having difficulty in communicating, troubled minded such like suicide thoughts, troubled behaviours, or traumatic minded. And a Psychologist only can provide counselling therapy or perhaps hypnotism to help people who had trouble minded to ‚Äúwalk out‚Äù from their troubled issues. They don't have the license to dispense medications. Whereas a Psychiatrist is a specialist that listen, analyst the patient's troubled issues and have the license to dispense suitable medications according to their expertise decisions. But on certain days this Clinic Pakar Au Yong have a temporary Psychologist available. Each doctors have their own patients. They are open from Monday to Friday from 08:30am to 3:00pm, Saturday from 08:00am to 12:00pm noon. Sunday is close. Besides good psychiatrists, this clinic also has lots of good quality medicines, both local manufactured and imported (originals and generics). For first timer, before going there, you must call up to make an appointment, either Doctor Au Yong or Doctor Francis. Either one, both are good doctors, very experienced and patience with  listening and analyzing each patient's cases. And is not like a Psychologist's treatment session, charging by hour's rate. You are free to consult out your troubled issue (depending on how severe or complicated your mental problem), but certainly not too long like 2 or 3 hours. Both doctors are Chinese, but speaks fluent English, and also Mandarin, or other local languages like Hokkian or Cantonese. They treat all age's patients from young children, young adult, mid age adult to old folks. Very friendly and patience, don't worry. Unlike some other doctors either very arrogant/ impatience or too serious types. Last part, the charging cost. All I can say is, it's very subjective. It all depends on each individual's case, how many types of medicines or types of medicines prescribe / give. The consultation fee is included in with the medication's fees. Roughly a guide line between RM300 minimum to a few hundreds. Remember, is a private clinic, not a government funded clinic. Ok, if you're new, you may feel the cost or charge is expensive like a bomb's price, I can say, comparing to other privatized psychiatrist clinics, this clinic consider average charging cost. But, the medicines prescribe or give, certainly are good quality and are effective to solve whatever your troubled mental's issues. You can't compare it with a government's clinic example Hospital University Malaya at PJ. They too have a psychiatrist department. But a day only accept 50 patients. Opens from morning 09:00am and many people lining up waiting for the psychiatrist department to open and ""fighting"" to grab a number. If the number is finished for the day, you've got no choice but to come the next day and following days until you managed to get your number for that day to be able to get treatment by a psychiatrist. And the medicines given mostly are generic or local manufactured or either the dosage is low and inactive, unlike privatized clinic's medicines. If you choose to go to the government's, (is your choice) if the medicines doesn't work, then too bad. Clinic Pakar Au Yong's medicines I can guarantee you 98% sure able to solve your problems. Environment also is clean and pleasant. But not luxury like a 5 star private hospital. The treatment success rate is high, perhaps 85%."

Anyway i started screaming from pain to the point they called their female doctor she came to the center and finally allowed them to give me my original medicine that i took to them and im addicted on .. so i lost consciousness and in the morning she came to me and she now realizing that a hospital isnt going to work THEY ARE FINDING THAT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME .. anyway she offers me a plan B where i keep taking the same addiction medicine and they will try to taper it over 5 or 6 months .. she talked to my wife and told her about that plan my wife said we need time to think cuz the trama my husband took today in your center is unforgivable they dunno what are they doing she said isent my husband to you to take care of him instead u go to emergency rooms begging people to take him off ur hands ??? And then u take him back take his phone laptop every thing and throw him in a room to sleep without even a phone in case an emergancy happened and he needed help he needs to call somebody .. no they dont trust you and deal with u as a crazy person with no dignity , not only that and only gave him his medicine after started screaming in all the place and he was about to die ?? How ridicules is that.!

Anyway im now going to our lawyer to make them refund our money since they faild to deliver on their promisses and we tried with them for the refund they said no we dont return anything.. they give you lies and fake promises to get you to pay and then throw you on the street .."

International Psychology Centre also provides the right references and tools for the students to gain knowledge and later apply it in their practice.

The clinical supervisions are one of my favorite parts of the whole experience because we can go through different cases, hear the other interns‚Äô opinions and questions, and more importantly get Dr. Edward‚Äôs reflection on that.

Another thing that I liked was the application of holistic and nutritional medicine in psychology. Dr. Edward always points out that a lot of mental struggles can be treated using the right nutrients."

He judged my choices as 'dangerous', and behaved towards me like I was a rebellious teenager - very condescending.

In my opinion, this is one of the best psychiatry specialist clinic I have ever went to. The receptionist and staff dispensing the medications were very-very helpful, polite and courteous to answer any of my question in regards to the treatment given.

Dr Tan is very empathetic to me, and he understand about the issues in regards to cost of the treatment as well as the continuation of the treatment not only in the short-term time period, but on a longer run.

He‚Äôd even came out with suggestions and recommendations based on his knowledge and experience in order for me to get the best treatment plan. I actually really-really appreciate and thankful for his treatment and manner to me.

The clinic also were located strategically in the Melaka town, and parking won‚Äôt be any problem at all for me. The clinic even have a wheelchair entrance and the waiting time also is very acceptable. In terms of the cost of the treatment itself, it is slightly cheaper as compared to other private psychiatry center.

As a MD myself, here is some advise to those who wishes to see a psychiatrist,. As a patient, we need to disclose any symptoms, problems or complications arise from our own illness or if we suffered the side effects from medications prescribed to get a proper treatment.

I do understand that it is psychiatrist duty to explore about our conditions, but psychiatrist are human too. They can interpret our behaviors and signs, but they can't read our mind.

If we think that the doctor doesn't even ask or miss whatever things or issues that we thought were important, we can simply tell the doctors about it during consultation, not after we went back home and then started to complaint about the issues. Avoid getting consultation from phone calls.

One more things, most of the time, medications use in psychiatry usually will take some times for our body to adapt. Doctors will adjust the dosage accordingly, just like in my case.

In summary, I recommended this clinic to those who wishes to initiate the treatment in regards to mental illness. Of course I couldn‚Äôt disclose any information in regards to my treatment, but I am sure that the treatment provided is definitely worth it."

For example, when i told him that i have ptsd, he doesn't even care about how i developed it and didn't even ask for any question about my conditions.

After i took the medications for one week. i developed some anxiety symptoms. So, my dad called the clinic . Instead of telling me to stop the medications, the doctor told me to take for another week when he knew that i really cant bear with the side effects anymore.

The doctor is also quite arrogant as he keep mentioning that he is teaching in which university. A patient doesnt care about where you teach, we just care about the service that u provided to us. Overall, I don't recommend this doctor to others."

The school does not look like anything in the internet photos. I took my mild autism son out after 3 months in the school (sent him for 2 weeks out of 4 weeks), showed no signs of progress, the owner of the school also did not have a consultation session to discuss my son's progress in the school. i contacted the class teacher many times to seek progress - all i get is a 5mins chat outside the school gate asking for my son's progress which i initiated. A teacher called ‚ÄúJ‚Äù -  i find her rude because there was once, after first day of sending son, i wanted to know how he was doing but NONE of teachers were available, his class teacher was pretending to hide in the kitchen, ‚ÄúJ‚Äù was near the door attending to another parent - completely ignored me -  not even tried to say ""sorry mam, im attending to one parent here, we will attend to you shortly'. instead ‚ÄúJ‚Äù pretended not to see me. she also did an assessment test for my son the first time, really not attentive, i had a 3 months old baby that i had to bring along while bringing my son for an assessment. ‚ÄúJ‚Äù appeared to be rude, unfriendly and not attentive at all. for that 3 months my son was in the school, i was not satisfied with the way they conduct their classes, carry themselves, and the progress (albeit a small amount if any) my son had in that short period of time. worst still, the school even had a nickname for my son when he was there. Louis centre is a very traumatizing experience both for my son and myself. i dont even know if the teachers there are fully qualified to teach special children. their owners yes, they are well endowed with titles and profession wise - but their staffs, i am not sure. i pulled my son out of the school because they sacked his class teacher from her work, and informed her that they cant keep my son at the school. the school DID NOT contact me. how professional is that? so his class teacher called me and inform me that.  i decided to pull him out of the school after the class teacher inform me of the situation, and also because he did not show progress and i worried of his welfare if i continue sending him there - as it is, they already brand my son with a name calling. Overall, Not recommended."

Now that my son is a teenager, he goes to a mainstream school. But with this pandemic, learn at home: D The performance is great! As my son grew up, there were many complications in his behavior. It's too hyper, even the speech isn't clear. Stir up your friends while learning. The kindergarten teacher always complains. We do not know how to change and correct the problems our children face at that time. Fortunately I had a good colleague share information about this special school, so my husband and I agreed to attend a free assesment and find out that my son has ADHD, sensory problems and a bit of Autism. Her school principals, Mrs. Julia and Dr Rajan, helped us a lot in understanding what Autism is and what we need to do so our children can improve. Our son only studied and underwent therapy for a year there and thank God I had a lot of changes and my husband could see her. Their teachers and therapists are always sharing with us what they can do at home as well to help accelerate their progress. My husband and I are very grateful for the help we have received from this school for many years now. We hope this school will continue to excel and continue to help the children in this specialty. They are the children of heaven "

Updates: waited for nearly 2 hours, mentioned that theres 2 person in front of me. What‚Äôs the purpose of making an appointment? The receptionist is making normal person become abnormal, cause of their service.

It is a mental health clinic yet patients are left to suffer and wait extremely long hours and not to mention their EXTREMELY RUDE and unfriendly front desk staffs (typical morning market aunties rather than trained professionals).

Sadly one day I disassociated and freaked out ‚Äî it eventually led me to a centre which was when I met my current doctor who this time ACTUALLY TOOK NOTES DOWN, and not tells me how hes ‚Äúgot it in my head‚Äù ; managed to diagnose me with CPTSD in less than thirty mins and with that I am not properly treating my issues and I‚Äôve never felt more alive and well.

But if I stuck with this clinic, not only my weight would go up but my wallet would go dry as he was overcharging me, but my health overall would‚Äôve deteriorated severely and at a fast speed!

DO NOT COME HERE AND SEEK HELP ELSEWHERE. Do your research bout mental health and know what kind of outcome should come out of these visits with ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù and don‚Äôt simply agree with everything just cause they‚Äôre professionals cause some doctors might not even be on the registry list!"

MMHA is headquartered in a literal House. In front of a mosque. Initially I was surprised to see this. But I kept an open mind and still look forward to the diagnostic. Upon reaching I was greeted by the receptionist who was fidgety and not very easy to communicate with.

The psychologist came 30 minutes late and I went in to meet him.I have met other psychologist from other institutes but this 'psychologist' made me feel Incredibly Stressed and acted in a very intimidating way. When I tried to explain my situation with notes provided by my previous therapist. He did not want to listen to them. When I told him my situation he treated it like my problems were minor and brushed them off and I was just whining. There was also an MMHA intern in the room with me, which he did not introduce to me at all. When I asked him who she was, he grunted and just said she worked here. He asked a lot of questions that did not concern my matter and in the end just referred me to ""the mind faculty'.

In the end I think i felt worse of than if I never met him. His name is Dr. Navin Nair A/L Narayanan. He did not explain what accreditation he had, he just said 'I work In UM'. A quick google search shows he is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist. But only studies 'Psychology Medicine'.

Do note that at the physical place or the website they do not state how their psychologist are accredited. Not even the receptionist knows how he is accredited. Overall It was a negative experience for me. I recommend you seek somewhere else any ,come to this place if it's your last resort. Or just want an unprofessional checkup.

Appointments are booked at least a month ahead, otherwise you are on the 'waiting list' whereby you show up when doors open and wait for a chance that another patient will be late or if the doctor is able to squeeze in 10 minutes for your consultation. Even with appointments, you need to wait at least half an hour to an hour.

Nurses are rude and irritable. Most patients are elderly and are quite lost or confused, they get snapped at if they ask too many questions. A patient was asking if they had a mirror because she needed to apply topical cream to a rash on her forehead and the nurse shouted ""no mirrors we can't have mirrors here don't you know that, go find your own mirror""

Doctor Lee however is gentle and seems to be quite tactical at prescribing medications. However do not expect therapy or counselling. It is strictly psychiatry.

There is a long wait, whether it's already set or at least an hour. It is recommended to have a meal nearby. Nurses are not kind and will be scolded for asking small questions. The doctor is good, just to help you choose medicine, but time is limited, so no psychological analysis"

My sessions with her never felt rushed and I always felt that I was being heard. That itself was therapeutic for me. Going for therapy was the best investment I had made for myself. Ms Sitra is indeed a Psychologist par excellence! Thank you!!!"

PPL IM TELLING YOU SAVE UR MONEY AND GO TO A REAL DOCTOR INSTEAD these people are frauds ..

Anyway when i went to them , i sat down with their unprofessional so called medical team they told me now were gonna send u to a hospital and they take me in a car we litterly spend 15 houres trying to get into hoslitals and none of them accepted taking me in.. and when they tell u we have hospitals that are in contract with us dont belive them .. they take u there at the emergency room and start begging nurses to take u they told them dont throw ur problems at us we cant take him cuz so we went to 4 hospitals and their staff ibrahim tells me to lie to the doctors and tell them you are in a horrible pain so they take you .. this is how they mean of sending you to a hospital.. non of the hospitals take them seriously and treat them like a joke .. they are just a big nice house with baloons .. then we went back to their center they wanted to take all my phones its not allowed to take ur phone to ur bed u need to give it away .. and when u make a pee test they will force u to make it in front of their staff , they send someone named mahdi with u inside the bathroom to watch you pee cuz they dont trust you even if you went to them voluntarily!!! Anywah laptops are forbidden everything is forbidden, by that time we came back in my widrawal symptoms kicked in i started shaking and tearing and begging them to give me my midicine.. do u know what they offer me ????? One tablet of ( voltarine ü§î) the muscle midicine.. what the hell is this ?????

I told them im addicted to a very strong OPI medicine and the widthrawal symptoms are lethal they can cause actual death and ur offering me a voltarine ??????

Anyway i started screaming from pain to the point they called their female doctor she came to the center and finally allowed them to give me my original medicine that i took to them and im addicted on .. so i lost consciousness and in the morning she came to me and she now realizing that a hospital isnt going to work THEY ARE FINDING THAT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME .. anyway she offers me a plan B where i keep taking the same addiction medicine and they will try to taper it over 5 or 6 months .. she talked to my wife and told her about that plan my wife said we need time to think cuz the trama my husband took today in your center is unforgivable they dunno what are they doing she said isent my husband to you to take care of him instead u go to emergency rooms begging people to take him off ur hands ??? And then u take him back take his phone laptop every thing and throw him in a room to sleep without even a phone in case an emergancy happened and he needed help he needs to call somebody .. no they dont trust you and deal with u as a crazy person with no dignity , not only that and only gave him his medicine after started screaming in all the place and he was about to die ?? How ridicules is that.!

Anyway im now going to our lawyer to make them refund our money since they faild to deliver on their promisses and we tried with them for the refund they said no we dont return anything.. they give you lies and fake promises to get you to pay and then throw you on the street .."

I had visited Dr. Suban despite him being widely recognized as a Child expert. He is efficient and is capable of working with adults but also young guns in anxiety.

I opted for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and went through a stringent 4 rounds to identify the problems I have had mentally - going through gaslighting, humiliation and politics of my former corporate that I lost confidence in myself.

My story is that at one point, I was in disbelief, anguished, angry, vengeful and also negative in that regard, thinking of the past instead of moving forward and wanting to hurt people as well as name calling publicly.

Dr. Suban helped me to identify what I was going through. He was being REAL with me, and finding out what I lost that resulted in the atrocious state of mental health. For over a year, it's affected my current work but also I developed headaches and unnecessary stress.

In the beginning, I stated that I needed a consultation for 'sports' purposes because of my outside-of-work interest that mirrors the athletic mind. And my belief system of routine-based and consistent working on the self allows me to work with Dr. Suban, using Cognitive Behaviour Therapy easily (which requires your own dedication and exercise).

I did the CBT journaling daily and, after a period of time, I discovered that I had lost my sense of self-respect and self-love for more than a year. I had stopped believing in myself and second guessed my conscience - which proved that the gaslighting was effective. And, despite my former colleagues finding out that I was on the right at the end, and I have all the proofs to validate my claim to take revenge, I REFUSED to because it would perjure my moral ideals.

It's safe to say that I have now recovered well, and my mindset is much better, that not only will I walk tall from here forth and that my routine-style of living and continuous identification of problems with CBT, Dr. Suban has earned a forever friendship that I will visit from time to time.

I highly recommend visiting PowerSub One-Stop Mental Health Care Services to work on yourself. It's a team game to go far. It's definitely not just for kids."

Even the kpj jmc gleneagle private hospital is shared with government doctors.

But there is also an old sign, Dr Chew Psychiatrist. For a long time, the Sabahs in need can visit him, they are private specialists.
On the main road and then the third floor.

I think not many people know it, so share! #anxiety

This is one of few specialist psychiatry in KK if you happened to need treatment. Swasta, and price is okay about RM 150, 200ish.
Share it out!

Call to set an appointment with Dr Choo, a chinese lady pick up the phone while still talking to somebody else. she then ask me what is my intention of calling?

i explain to her that i wanted to set an appointment with Dr Choo, her next question is ""have you ever come to this clinic? are you an existing patient?""

which i replied: No, its my first time, I was introduced by a friend.

She then asked me in Bahasa Malaysia ""Oh apa sakit kau?"" (oh whats your medical problem)

for 32 years i been alive i made numerous of clinic/hospital appointment, BUT never have I encounter a clinic nurse/reception that inquire such question, exception for hospital because obviously they have to ask since there's lots of departments in a hospital, but never have i experienced such with a GP clinic.

regardless i still remain positive and explain to her my concern, which is abdominal pain, and i said maybe to check with ultrasound scan or just get doctor opinion

her response: why dont you go for kissey or hospital such as JMC or KPJ? Doctor here cant do anything for you

shocked with her response i then asked her, ""so i cant get consultation from doctor first?""

She then said: yes you may, but what is your sickness? (her voice is a little more stern at this time)

asking me this same question the second time, seems very persistent to shoo me away.

I reply: well i dont know what is my problem, that is why i wanted to get consultation

**isnt that is the main reason we go see doctors? to get their opinion? even i cant do ultrascan sound, is it so wrong to see the doctor and discuss my health problem? if i know what my diagnose is, why would i bother to get doctor consultation. for me the nurse is asking a beyond stupid question! and is she is more capable than the doctor that she will decide and filter out which patients to see the doctor and which shouldn't?, i specifically said i wanted to get consultations, i didn't emphasize on doing radiography examinations! **

her reply to that was: well doctor cant do anything, plus tomorrow we half day, appointment full.

well if she mentioned, doctor fully book right in the beginning, I would have believe it. but after all those interrogations, and giving me excuses and more excuses. seems like she just said it is fully booked to shut me down

The registration is swift; the antenatal checkups are informative and assuring. Nurses call you for appointments confirmation. Which sometimes can wait upwards to 2 hours as there are a lot of other mothers. I guess this is seasonal but can be improved upon, nonetheless KKIA can take average of 4 hours.

During delivery, the nurses are very helpful, polite, and friendly. They guide you through the process and inform us of the expectations which is quite comforting.

After delivery, the maternity ward nurses have the same quality all the way. Helpful, friendly, informative. They took good care of the baby in the nursery while the parents rest. May request a pop up bed for father to rest. The doctor can answer any of your concerns up until discharge.

All in all 5 star experience.

Only grievances I have is the expensive parking rates which I think can be covered together in the hospital bill (like in hotels)."

Late the density for this group of people move a little of them back to societies. This it a small step. But it a big steps it u considered that we put 30 years for this. People ask me why I come to this place,at u are total recovered. Ya, know that more of them recovered but never admitted they are having mental health issue. So of them know clear their have mental issues but don't want to come and treat here. Why because may think that mental illness it weak character and admitting suffer from mental illness it some thing to be ashamed. YB Fatimat recently said on the news papers around 40% of general population it having mental illness. Following treatment at hospital sentoso alone that reported to YB Lo it 20,000 people want the faction hold on April 4/2017. Some people may ask u r recovered, that not need to take medication and following up at hospital, well this it a chronic illness, this illness it treatable but not curable and the meds just control u illness. So that it courage to continues taking meds as that's courage to go to see doctor when u r well because u can get the right information to prevent relapse. In mental illness ,relapse happen. So the medication team it always ready, r u ready because with u initiative to looking help,u r also a key person . doctor as the key person in medication team with therapy ,counsellor,nurse. How do they help u if u did not accepted the help from the professional."

2. The doctor himself is very soft spoken. His explanation is so clear with the some figure aided better understanding. All my question answered clearly. He is quite old means is experienced & the patients also mostly veteran.

Perhaps Borneo should provide toilet outside too so ur staff don't overeact over fevered patient using the toilet? Not only that her English is bad, what if I am international patient will she be answering in Malay to me too when I have requested to communicate in english?

My mom already felt very unwell yet all she cares about was my mom should be outside and keep on repeating that word when I tried to explain that's when I got mad and complaint. She even suggested us to go other hospital if unsatisfied with her service but the first thing I go to counter her attitude and tone was very unfriendly like unhappy to work on holiday and ask me why am I there, we are there for emergency case of course or else u think patients love to visit hospital? We visited here because we have records here as regular customer. Please ensure such attitude would not be brought to workplace and we owe you nothing. I hope we are paying for what we deserve, we hope BMC makes improvement and we will still visit for PET scan here. I did not react in time or I would have recorded her attitude as proof. The beginning happened without other staffs and witnesses around so I appeared to be a rude customer instead when they came afterwards as I complaint. My apologies for negative response too, as human i tend to be reflection of others but i do not want to be adult who do not apologize and my different response to other staffs shall be clear enough why i was triggered.

How can there be 6 people ahead of her when her appointment was for 9:30AM? They kept letting walk-ins cut the queue and go ahead first, then what's the point of an appointment?? Never again."

She suffered mild fever and heavy cough last midnight. She waited for one hour and 45 minutes to receive treatment (which was never).

Regular blood check-up was carried out and it was fine. I tried to justify to the long hours of waiting but I could not accept the answers that the doctor  in charge gave. He said that there are more seriously ill patients that need the care more than my mum does, a stroke patient who got fever, not FEVERISH. I am sure he is just about making that statement as there were many patients needed treatment. Second triage was expected but never avail.

I canceled and call it a night around 2 a.m. as my mum could not sit on the wheelchair for a long period of time. There were no special need toilets for OKUs around ER available. So, if you are on a wheel chair, you could wear adult-diapers early to avoid unnecessary circumstances.

For KKM, please make sure these officers esp the doctors speak nicely to customers. I was sad by the level of answer received does not have enough empathy. I am not asking sympathy from you guys at ER Kuala Berang, just BE BETTER.

WHY I did not go to other clinic? It was midnight and other places were closed. I needed attention to my mother's illness and not for me. Hospital Kuala Berang ER gave the first triage and not the second one. May have to write a letter of complaint."

Parking space is very limited there's nothing can be done.

Could be improved:
Cafeteria was so-so not so clean there was a lot of uncleaned tables and spillage near the drinks station. The toilets after the ED was in bad shape, some faucets was damaged too.

Good experience:
The hospital is quick with their diagnostic imaging, only have to wait for doctor to arrive for a diagnose.

Bad experience:
I was chased out by the security guards for simply waiting at a nearby seating area in front of ED. The reason was because it was solely for ED patients, but no prohibition signs or whatsoever was put on place. Where else can next of kin wait waiting for hours? squat in front of the ED entrance??  To make matters worse, right after after my brother was discharge from ED, his request for a simple discharge note was simply brushed off rudely by the doctor on duty (past 3pm shift change) , he said ""you are just paying RM1! don't expect too much by requesting such things, who else would need such a note"" my brother is a civil servant too and this is the best that a public doctor can do? such a disappointment tbh."

MMHA is headquartered in a literal House. In front of a mosque. Initially I was surprised to see this. But I kept an open mind and still look forward to the diagnostic. Upon reaching I was greeted by the receptionist who was fidgety and not very easy to communicate with.

The psychologist came 30 minutes late and I went in to meet him.I have met other psychologist from other institutes but this 'psychologist' made me feel Incredibly Stressed and acted in a very intimidating way. When I tried to explain my situation with notes provided by my previous therapist. He did not want to listen to them. When I told him my situation he treated it like my problems were minor and brushed them off and I was just whining. There was also an MMHA intern in the room with me, which he did not introduce to me at all. When I asked him who she was, he grunted and just said she worked here. He asked a lot of questions that did not concern my matter and in the end just referred me to ""the mind faculty'.

In the end I think i felt worse of than if I never met him. His name is Dr. Navin Nair A/L Narayanan. He did not explain what accreditation he had, he just said 'I work In UM'. A quick google search shows he is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist. But only studies 'Psychology Medicine'.

Do note that at the physical place or the website they do not state how their psychologist are accredited. Not even the receptionist knows how he is accredited. Overall It was a negative experience for me. I recommend you seek somewhere else any ,come to this place if it's your last resort. Or just want an unprofessional checkup. But If you really need help urgently and can't afford to pay for the fees offered by other institutes, then go ahead and come here."

It is vital to have the logic to know what is actually going on and how it affects us ,so be patient with the one to one talking session. Once the started the healing session, relax yourself and just follow every instructions that given by the master, all you need to do is to enjoy the process and live at the moment. As for me, this session is pretty helpful to me, especially when the master analyse your current condition mentally and physically after the healing session , somehow the master will provide tips and solutions to help improve some of the conditions .

I had visited Dr. Suban despite him being widely recognized as a Child expert. He is efficient and is capable of working with adults but also young guns in anxiety.

I opted for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and went through a stringent 4 rounds to identify the problems I have had mentally - going through gaslighting, humiliation and politics of my former corporate that I lost confidence in myself.

My story is that at one point, I was in disbelief, anguished, angry, vengeful and also negative in that regard, thinking of the past instead of moving forward and wanting to hurt people as well as name calling publicly.

Dr. Suban helped me to identify what I was going through. He was being REAL with me, and finding out what I lost that resulted in the atrocious state of mental health. For over a year, it's affected my current work but also I developed headaches and unnecessary stress.

In the beginning, I stated that I needed a consultation for 'sports' purposes because of my outside-of-work interest that mirrors the athletic mind. And my belief system of routine-based and consistent working on the self allows me to work with Dr. Suban, using Cognitive Behaviour Therapy easily (which requires your own dedication and exercise).

I did the CBT journaling daily and, after a period of time, I discovered that I had lost my sense of self-respect and self-love for more than a year. I had stopped believing in myself and second guessed my conscience - which proved that the gaslighting was effective. And, despite my former colleagues finding out that I was on the right at the end, and I have all the proofs to validate my claim to take revenge, I REFUSED to because it would perjure my moral ideals.

It's safe to say that I have now recovered well, and my mindset is much better, that not only will I walk tall from here forth and that my routine-style of living and continuous identification of problems with CBT, Dr. Suban has earned a forever friendship that I will visit from time to time.

I highly recommend visiting PowerSub One-Stop Mental Health Care Services to work on yourself. It's a team game to go far. It's definitely not just for kids."

With the stigma of mental health in Malaysia, I was nervous going in, but by the end Dr. Stephen created a safe space where I was comfortable and accepting of my problems, and more importantly, aware that I can change them with treatment. He patiently discussed my issues and explained to me whatever I couldn‚Äôt understand or had trouble realising.

When I arrived there, I was relieved to see the clinic was not crowded (only 3 patients waiting) and they adhered to the SOP by sitting more than 3 meters away from each other.

To be honest, I was in awe. The nurses and doctor were really quick and efficient in doing their work. The duration of the whole process, from registering my name, checking my blood pressure, getting my vaccine and waiting during the 15 min observation period, it only took 30 mins in total!

Dr Narinder, a truly skilled, professional and caring doctor. Before injecting the vaccine, she adhered to the protocol strictly. She made sure I did not have any health complications/allergies, showed me the vaccine bottle as well as explaining the side effects that might arise after vaccination thoroughly. More importantly, she showed me the syringe containing the vaccine before and after the jab to give me assurance that she had done her job. During the 15 min observation period, the doctor went out of her way and check on each patient one by one (including me) just to ensure we are doing fine.

All in all, I‚Äôm just glad my first vaccination experience was wonderful and it is all thanks to the hardworking nurses and Dr. Narinder in Klinik Alam Medic! I sincerely hope more doctors in private clinics will also be given the chance to be PPV as well as more vaccines will be given to the current existing private clinic as PPV to speed up the vaccination rate. It is so much more convenient and safer compared to other big PPV centres which are usually crowded due to long queue. Can‚Äôt wait to get my second dose of vaccine here soon!"

He listens to my concerns and pains, and I think that's how a psychiatrist should be to have an accurate diagnosis. I have taken the new medication he prescribed, and I find that the medicines help me with little or no downside. Dr.Jeya's clinic may not be fully furnished, but it's well cleaned. The only con is that he always seems not available in the afternoon after 12pm, nurses claimed that he is visiting other patients outside the clinic.

Further updates after 3 visits:
I have IED + depression, the medicine given to me by my previous psychiatrist other than being costly, they does not help but in fact giving side effects. So, I have Dr.Jeya to re-diagnose my illness, and after 6 weeks of taking the medicine prescribed by him, I am alive again. I managed to have my life back on track, myself & my family is so greatful to have  Dr.Jeya as my psychiatrist.

From my personal experience that have took me a year to find out, if you are having doubts about your existing psychiatrist or medicine, it's better to have another psychiatrist to re-diagnose your case.

Dr.Jeya's charges are so friendly that seeing a psychiatrist is no longer available for the rich only."

Contrary to existing reviews, I do appreciate Dr Lim's candor. Very straightforward but with a handful of empathy.

While I consider continuing to seek treatment from Dr Lim, the overall experience leaves much to be desired. The 2nd review accompanied by my bf (requested by Dr Lim) to assist the diagnosis felt extremely rushed, juxtaposed to the 45mins long 1st consultation my mom sat in for. I was oblivious that the duration for all subsequent visits are 15 mins sessions, which we found out after I unknowingly paid for an overrun.

The experience could be improved if the receptionist were to inform me of every item charged for the clinic visit. I was verbally informed of the review (15mins session) fee + medication, but not the additional 1/2 block (+$50) for an overrun that was charged. The full itemised bill came as a rude shock after payment was made.

Though the receptionist was quick to explain the charges when enquired, provision of information of charges before the session begins would really help avoid minor inconsistencies in service that stresses patients. It could have been avoided with a more meticulous rundown on the sessions and charges.

I would still consider my overall experience at Dr Lim's clinic a positive one based on the 1st consultation despite this really unpleasant incident on my 2nd visit."

I went to see Dr Lim last year as his name was the first that came up in the google search results.
During the session, he diagnosed me with adjustment disorder.
Upon further questions about my diagnosis, he actually questioned my reason for visiting him. He very not empathetic throughout the session and he was also trying to implying that I was FAKING my illness.
Honestly, I do not think anyone with a logical mind would pay $200-$300+ and travel all the way down to your clinic just to pretend to be ""ill""?
My family was outraged by the cold and unempathetic attitude.
We never went back and subsequently I found very caring doctors who genuinely cared me and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, medicine was given as well.
Lesson learnt is not to choose the first doctor you see on search results and read all reviews before visiting!
Can you imagine a patient who was at their lowest and decided to seek help but was treated like this?
Very bad experience. Don't even deserve a star.
We will definitely not visit this clinic again. We also do not recommend this clinic to those seeking for hope in troubled times of illness."

Before having these issues, I‚Äôve been lacking focus in my life for many years. Until I seek helps from Dr. Lim this April, I was diagnosed with mild depression. I am glad to visit him early, otherwise I don‚Äôt think I am still surviving because I have suicidal thoughts when I couldn‚Äôt sleep for weeks coupling with severe anxiety disorder. After taking the medicines prescribed, although the first few weeks were rough with side effects, I felt better after the adjustment period. The medicines did its job to reduce the obsessive side of my depression and remove my constant invasive terrible thoughts. I am much more sociable, confident and pretty much getting my life back on track now. If you‚Äôre not feeling ok and need immediate assistance, I highly recommend Dr. Lim rather than going to polyclinic, get referral to see psychiatrists in general hospitals because the waiting time is super long. This is to prevent tragedy from happening because mental illness is something that cannot be ignored/neglected. It will directly affect our physical health."

I got her name registered and told nurses at clinic at 8th floor that I will bring my mum at 10.25am . This is because of my mum is very old and afraid of interaction with people when crowded. I came and doctor went for rounds. Told to wait 1hour. No courtesy to call and inform and then she had to wait for doctor to come in only can do blood test. I said we don't want to find and while doctor is away we can do blood check. We cams back at Conic at 11.30am waited for doctor and other patients went in.  When asked an hour later the nurse said have to wait for blood test before seeing doctor. What rubbish. Clearly if the normal nurse for clinic around it won't happen. Nurse went for leave for wedding. I think it's just pure poor management.  This is my worst experience in this hospital. The doctor is the best in the hospital I got no complaints but compliments. I think the hospital CEO has to look into this or he change personnel.

It saved me from my suicide thoughts , but it has a lot of bad effects (very bad effects) that made my life VERY BAD , even many months I stop the medicine. And the worse thing is he did NOT tell me about those side effects when we starting the medicine , which cause me LOTS AND LOTS of harm. Seeing him every month yet he got more and more impatient each visit , to end my visit fast and quick. The doctor went and started saying certain things that doctors should NEVER tell their patients , especially MENTAL HEALTH patient!!! And some time later he then say my depression is not serious and he has gone through worse stuff so I should learn to deal with it??? What kind of doctor will say this to someone who is going through such a bad thing. Yes , his medications work of course , but while this doctor knows what he does and can give you some medication plans , he is not an ""empathetic"" and kind doctor. That is why I am giving 2 stars.

When we arrived early 2 days later for ultrasound, we were made to wait for almost an hour! After numerous checking with the registration counter, she said it was not her problem because there were 3 patients inside and we still need to WAIT although our appointment time has passed!!!
This is unacceptable because we are paying customers and this is not the expected service by a private hospital. There were only a handful of nurses around and i can see that they could not cope with the tests.
Worse still, when we finally made our way to the imaging department, the staff inside mentioned she was waiting for our arrival since 8:30am, and we were made to WAIT and WAIT outside at the registration counter!! Why is there no communication??!!!üò°üò°üò°"

Asked for a Dr's letter but he didn't dare to write down BPD in the letter, second session only focused on my panic attacks and not BPD and gets impatient when I asked him why he's not treating me for BPD. So what's the point of the diagnosis?

Went to another private Dr after that and she rolled her eyes saying that Dr Ang should exclude ADD/ADHD first before settling on BPD. Wasted my time and money on a rude and inompetent doctor with no bedside manners. Dr Ang is very keen to prescribe medications but not follow through with therapy and counselling. Don't recommend unless you want to feel more upset, waste your time/money and risk medication dependency."

When dr ang asked if i had any history of suicide, before I could reply him, he already went and said ""I guess not"" and continue on talking for the remainder of the session without giving me a chance to correct his assumption. After that, I am no longer sure I was able to trust him to help in my recovery. I guess it was because I mentioned to him that i was reading self help books and he just assumed I was doing well. However it is because reading was not helping at all that i went to see a doctor. If your definition of therapy is to listen to a doctor talk, then I highly recommend dr ang. He likes to talk, a lot in fact, to the point where he's just the one talking. I'm not sure if the session is about me if I'm not able to have any inputs. I wish that effectiveness was measured by its cost, then it would be easiest to just choose the most expensive. But if it is not effective, am I supposed to continue paying despite not receiving results.

Past reviews are correct, you‚Äôll spend most of your time listening rather than discussing issues. There‚Äôs a lot of repetition, Dr Ang likes to repeat himself which gets tiring and frustrating.

My brother and I brought my mom to the emergency after she complained about stomach pain. We went to a private clinic (the doctor suggested my mom to get herself checked in a bigger facility -- we think the hospital, of course!), and then to HSA's polyclinic few days back, but her conditions worsen since then.

At the emergency, her BP, temperature, etc was checked, and the officer (not sure whether he was a Doctor) said that my mom's vital is fine, and she can go home, without even checking her stomach! My brother who is a veterinarian insisted that my mom be given more thorough checks, then in the midst of all that, a senior doctor came by and asked about my mother's condition.

Some more checks were done, and my mom was asked to stay in the emergency ward for few more hours until the results came back.

Despite all those checks, my mom was discharged a few hours later and was given a date for a follow-up appointment which will occur a few months later.

My mother was a civil servant, and she did not take up any medical cards or insurance coverage, trusting that the public health service was enough. So my brother and I decided to pool our savings and send my mom to a private facility the very next day. After spending some five-figures money for an endoscopy and three-night stay in the private ward, true enough, her stomach pain was not just bad food and gases. She had level 2 lymphoma, cancer! With the diagnosis, we got her admitted into another  public hospital immediately.

Imagine if we trusted and waited for the follow-up appointment given by the doctor at HSI."

Also some details may be hazy because this was years ago, BEFORE Covid.

1) Came in after having a fever for 2 days. I normally wouldn't think a fever is a big deal, and expected to be quickly sent away with prescriptions, like with every other previous fevers.
At some point, a nurse pulled out a needle.
I wasn't fully acknowledging my disabilities at the time, because of self-denial. But looking back, I've known myself to have needle anxiety for a long time. So my unpreparedness at facing a needle that day actually made me feel faint, and the staff got worried. A nurse laid me down and checked whether I was going hypoglycemic. That somewhat upset me because that was a problem I've NEVER faced, but I completely understand that nobody knows my health history; you should prepare for the unexpected; etc.
Also, of course, I was biased against my own judgement, since the people surrounding me were medical professionals and I was just a patient. I was asking myself ""why SHOULD I speak up about my needle anxiety? Maybe they know better, and have seen this set of symptoms, etc.""
Then they actually had me transported for further treatments at the main hospital.
I keep thinking... if I DIDN'T have needle anxiety to the point of feeling faint, WOULD they have been so worried as to send me to the hospital?
...COULD everyone have just not used up time and resources? Could workers instead encourage patients more to speak up about what they think is happening to them, because they know themselves better?
MAYBE, if it weren't for the worry that I was in a critical condition, I could've not:
- had a urinary catheter inserted
- develop RASHES on my arms from how much they were struggling with IV therapy on me (too frequent skin sterilization?)
- have to suture a whole other IV thing on my thigh because it was so hard to do anything on my arms
- [I could add like 15 more points to this list]
- not get hospital-acquired pneumonia
- stayed there for 2 weeks
God knows what COULD have happened. The best we can hope for is that we keep an experience like this in mind, and always think on what could be improved.

2) Requesting days off from classes for a mental health break. Saw a male doctor.
I didn't know that doctor well, I don't know how he thinks, what his experiences are, his personal biases, his expectations, etc. -- I'm saying this because I would still validate everyone's experiences, even if I don't agree with the behaviors they end up showing.
When the doctor gives me TWO days off from class to recover... I'm disgusted. Of course, everyone's mental health is different. But I'm inclined to think that, to a LOT of chronically suffering folks, a mere two days of rest is straight up unfruitful. I've read a story on the Internet where a mother insisted on giving her child a mental health break that lasted WEEKS despite the school disagreeing, and the child later came back much healthier and happier.
I also see a possible other train of thought--that the doctor WANTED time for my mind to heal, but was worried about my academics.
This would be an instance our ideals not lining up. I couldn't care LESS about my academics crashing and burning, if my mind and emotions were numbing + my quality of life was deteriorating.
Possible takeaway from this event: maybe, we BOTH could've pushed a little harder. The doctor could've asked more questions, more specifically to coax truthful answers out of a fearful patient. While I could've insisted on putting my thoughts forward.

I understand that we're all human, CONSTANTLY experience communication breakdown, and that can never be blamed on solely one party. And sometimes things just happen for no reason. So my stories aren't necessarily like a complaint. Just food for thought. Stay healthy, and I want especially younger people to passionately FIGHT for confidence in yourself. I know part of me just died from years of self-deprecation, unable to express how I had OCD, anxiety and sensory sentivity."

PPL IM TELLING YOU SAVE UR MONEY AND GO TO A REAL DOCTOR INSTEAD these people are frauds ..

Anyway when i went to them , i sat down with their unprofessional so called medical team they told me now were gonna send u to a hospital and they take me in a car we litterly spend 15 houres trying to get into hoslitals and none of them accepted taking me in.. and when they tell u we have hospitals that are in contract with us dont belive them .. they take u there at the emergency room and start begging nurses to take u they told them dont throw ur problems at us we cant take him cuz so we went to 4 hospitals and their staff ibrahim tells me to lie to the doctors and tell them you are in a horrible pain so they take you .. this is how they mean of sending you to a hospital.. non of the hospitals take them seriously and treat them like a joke .. they are just a big nice house with baloons .. then we went back to their center they wanted to take all my phones its not allowed to take ur phone to ur bed u need to give it away .. and when u make a pee test they will force u to make it in front of their staff , they send someone named mahdi with u inside the bathroom to watch you pee cuz they dont trust you even if you went to them voluntarily!!! Anywah laptops are forbidden everything is forbidden, by that time we came back in my widrawal symptoms kicked in i started shaking and tearing and begging them to give me my midicine.. do u know what they offer me ????? One tablet of ( voltarine ü§î) the muscle midicine.. what the hell is this ?????

I told them im addicted to a very strong OPI medicine and the widthrawal symptoms are lethal they can cause actual death and ur offering me a voltarine ??????

Anyway i started screaming from pain to the point they called their female doctor she came to the center and finally allowed them to give me my original medicine that i took to them and im addicted on .. so i lost consciousness and in the morning she came to me and she now realizing that a hospital isnt going to work THEY ARE FINDING THAT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME .. anyway she offers me a plan B where i keep taking the same addiction medicine and they will try to taper it over 5 or 6 months .. she talked to my wife and told her about that plan my wife said we need time to think cuz the trama my husband took today in your center is unforgivable they dunno what are they doing she said isent my husband to you to take care of him instead u go to emergency rooms begging people to take him off ur hands ??? And then u take him back take his phone laptop every thing and throw him in a room to sleep without even a phone in case an emergancy happened and he needed help he needs to call somebody .. no they dont trust you and deal with u as a crazy person with no dignity , not only that and only gave him his medicine after started screaming in all the place and he was about to die ?? How ridicules is that.!

Anyway im now going to our lawyer to make them refund our money since they faild to deliver on their promisses and we tried with them for the refund they said no we dont return anything.. they give you lies and fake promises to get you to pay and then throw you on the street .."

Not 3 minutes into taking her history, and without asking any questions, he told my daughter that she has to go on the medication, Prozac. It was like he already decided that it was medication or nothing. As a parent, I questioned him in the alacrity of his decision in dispensing Prozac, almost like a one-size-fits-all kind of attitude. He told us that if we do not want to take medication, he can't treat my daughter. For that mere 7 minutes, we were slapped with a RM350+ bill.

Yesterday, we came to Singapore to seek treatment for my daughter. The psychiatrist she saw was really so much more professional and caring. She took my daughter's history for close to an hour, asking so many questions. Then she asked me into the consultation room and gave us a few options of treatment, of which, only one was taking medication,  and even then, she gave us 3 choices of medicines. With each choices of the medication,  she concisely briefed us through the side-effects. After that, she discussed the non-medication options as well. Then, she told us to go home and discuss the few options given and revert to her the following visit. The best part was that the lengthy and detailed session, with a doctor who was oozing with concern and care, only cost SGD140 (RM424).

I had initially given Dr Brian a one-star rating without any comments but after visiting the psychiatrist in Singapore yesterday, I had to share my experience with anyone who need help for the similar condition. Don't let any psychiatrist bully you into thinking that medication is the only way out."

Never ever consider seeing him if you have a mental health condition or struggles.

He doesn't empathise, doesn't explain his diagnosis and asks his patients to search things up themselves on WebMD.

He's harsh and impatient with his patients. He lashed out at my mother and caused her to have a breakdown. As a psychiatrist, people come to you for help when they're down. You are supposed to help them, not break them down further. He suggested for me to be checked into a psych ward for simply not following his advice. This is not acceptable.

Seeing other experiences and reviews from other people, it seems that I am not alone. Dr Brian Ho is a horrible doctor that shouldn't be allowed to practice psychiatry. Patients who see him will only be worse off. Look for another doctor, trust me."

2017 but took a bad turn in 2018
In general, Dr Brian is quite passive and content to wait for you to bring up your issues and is never very interested in patients(forgets your case and never checks case notes)
but he was street smart in terms of providing advice at managing a mental disorder at the workplace, which is not always easy to find.
Good guidance with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy as well.
And he is savvy at conveying to family members if they are part of the problem(he offers to talk to them and he is effective)

But after a year of seeing him, I felt we were just going round in circles- probably due to said passiveness and CBT never progressing beyond a behavioral journal.
Thus I ended the therapy around 2018.

However I recommended a friend to see him soon after, and they reported that Dr Brian Ho looked a shambles being unshaven and with messy hair
And he sounded utterly disinterested in mannerism and speech
Yet during this first visit without much interaction he  also made a snap judgement that my friend had a serious hereditary mental disorder.
Just off one very basic test and family history(only one distant aunt with the same condition iirc).
As he proceeded to recommend medication with strong side effects, this seemed a very rushed and hasty diagnosis. Moreover, his bedside manner left one very doubtful of his focus and abilities to make such a call.

I can only hope that Dr Brian was just undergoing a tough time at the time and is doing better these days as it was still a decent experience to have seen him back in the day."

One is Doctor Au Yong and another is Doctor Francis Lau. Both are very experienced psychiatrists. It's a private clinic, none government funded clinic. And also is a Psychiatrist professional clinic, not a Psychology clinic. There's a big difference between a psychiatrist and psychologist. Psychiatrist is a doctor that specializes in treating mental health issues such like insomnia, depression, or worst case scenario like people who had total mental breakdown perhaps suffered from a terrible tragedy or disaster before. Whereas a Psychologist doctor specializes in treating people who have suffered from mental discouragements and having difficulty in communicating, troubled minded such like suicide thoughts, troubled behaviours, or traumatic minded. And a Psychologist only can provide counselling therapy or perhaps hypnotism to help people who had trouble minded to ‚Äúwalk out‚Äù from their troubled issues. They don't have the license to dispense medications. Whereas a Psychiatrist is a specialist that listen, analyst the patient's troubled issues and have the license to dispense suitable medications according to their expertise decisions. But on certain days this Clinic Pakar Au Yong have a temporary Psychologist available. Each doctors have their own patients. They are open from Monday to Friday from 08:30am to 3:00pm, Saturday from 08:00am to 12:00pm noon. Sunday is close. Besides good psychiatrists, this clinic also has lots of good quality medicines, both local manufactured and imported (originals and generics). For first timer, before going there, you must call up to make an appointment, either Doctor Au Yong or Doctor Francis. Either one, both are good doctors, very experienced and patience with  listening and analyzing each patient's cases. And is not like a Psychologist's treatment session, charging by hour's rate. You are free to consult out your troubled issue (depending on how severe or complicated your mental problem), but certainly not too long like 2 or 3 hours. Both doctors are Chinese, but speaks fluent English, and also Mandarin, or other local languages like Hokkian or Cantonese. They treat all age's patients from young children, young adult, mid age adult to old folks. Very friendly and patience, don't worry. Unlike some other doctors either very arrogant/ impatience or too serious types. Last part, the charging cost. All I can say is, it's very subjective. It all depends on each individual's case, how many types of medicines or types of medicines prescribe / give. The consultation fee is included in with the medication's fees. Roughly a guide line between RM300 minimum to a few hundreds. Remember, is a private clinic, not a government funded clinic. Ok, if you're new, you may feel the cost or charge is expensive like a bomb's price, I can say, comparing to other privatized psychiatrist clinics, this clinic consider average charging cost. But, the medicines prescribe or give, certainly are good quality and are effective to solve whatever your troubled mental's issues. You can't compare it with a government's clinic example Hospital University Malaya at PJ. They too have a psychiatrist department. But a day only accept 50 patients. Opens from morning 09:00am and many people lining up waiting for the psychiatrist department to open and ""fighting"" to grab a number. If the number is finished for the day, you've got no choice but to come the next day and following days until you managed to get your number for that day to be able to get treatment by a psychiatrist. And the medicines given mostly are generic or local manufactured or either the dosage is low and inactive, unlike privatized clinic's medicines. If you choose to go to the government's, (is your choice) if the medicines doesn't work, then too bad. Clinic Pakar Au Yong's medicines I can guarantee you 98% sure able to solve your problems.

Dr. Edward is a knowledgeable psychologist who guides students via lectures, clinical supervision, and webinars.

International Psychology Centre also provides the right references and tools for the students to gain knowledge and later apply it in their practice.

The clinical supervisions are one of my favorite parts of the whole experience because we can go through different cases, hear the other interns‚Äô opinions and questions, and more importantly get Dr. Edward‚Äôs reflection on that.

Another thing that I liked was the application of holistic and nutritional medicine in psychology. Dr. Edward always points out that a lot of mental struggles can be treated using the right nutrients."

Honestly this is unacceptable by *Steven* who work for the visa department. I hope this clarifies for International Student and better to do your certificate course in some other centre rather than this one.

First of all, I'm really sorry, I am a Malaysian citizen, but I am still abroad.  During the epidemic period, I also understand your concerns.  But shouldn't you be a carer and caregiver who should be more caring and take care of patients? I don't know if this channel can respond to the concerns of those patients and their families.  Because I don't know which website I should mail to, about the complain  hospital in Kuantan Malaysia.

I briefly talk about the current situation.  My father's current foot was cut off due to diabetes. We as children are very worried about his condition.  Due to the differences in flights and national regulations during this period, returning to Malaysia is also a problem. So at present, only my mother and sister are taking care of his 80s old man.  Although we can't go back, but now the technology is developed, so our children use video to see father and mother every day.  We are also very worried about the well-being of their elderly people.

Seeing that my father's hands and feet are bruised, is it so rude and tight for the medical staff to bandage the wound to a patient?  Is your so-called medicine so bandaged? My dad's tubing needle fell off, and my mom also told the nurse to trouble them to come and help pick it up.  Their response was ""Wait"", and after a long time they haven't arrived and moved back again. A group of medical personnel simply cannot have racial discrimination and religious extremism.

I won't say much, save a life.  It‚Äôs better to read a day more scripture than everyone. Thank you ."

When I first came to see Dr. Wee, I was desperate and mentally exhausted. All I wanted was just to seek for some help from medicine, because I could no longer consume any verbal consultancy. But one real consultation session was far from what I had imagined. It was not purely a ‚Äúquestions and answers‚Äù meeting followed by some textbook advices. He attentively listened to everything I told no matter how emotional I was and how stupid my stories were, then would help me analyse the causes of my condition. It‚Äôs not easy to talk about your problems in front of a stranger, but trust me, Dr. Wee is different. He was so kind and patient that there were times I felt he was like a parent, a family member, someone from whom I was unable to hide my depressed soul üò¢. The first session with doctor helped me understand thoroughly many things, I felt that some heavy rocks in my heart were lifted up.
About medication: he would prescribe a small amount of drugs for the first period of time to see their effects on your body, and would switch to other drugs, so that the medication bring you the least side effects.
My personal thoughts on the medication, anti-depressant, specifically: it really helps in controlling my mood and depressive episodes, but cannot be the only solution for depression.
Have stopped seeing him already but still remember his advice ‚Äúdo exercise everyday‚Äù. Yes, I‚Äôm doing. And sleeping very well."

First met dr wee was about two years ago. Before meeting him, I have seen more than five psychiatrists, some of them are very famous in Malaysia. Why non stop changing psychiatrists?Yea, my bad, I got a really high expectation.No comments on their professionalism, but I couldn't find any connections with them. The biggest difference between Dr wee and other psychiatrists is, Dr wee is used to describe the action and reaction of the drugs and their side effects to us. At the same time, keep on trying out the best and most suitable medication so that it won't cause too much burden to our body. We able to discuss anything, like the selection of medications, dosage adjustment, etc. In addition, he is a really great listener, always on the fence, no simply judgement, provides the most professional advice. Words to describe him?Caring, kind and professional!He is really into his job, the best doctor ever.Ps, other than psychiatry consultation, he does provide hypnosis, psychotherapy & counseling.Last but not least,
well-known is not necessarily the best, the right one is the best! Stop struggling, only one step away!

I didn‚Äôt expect such a snail-paced service at a private hospital.
My wife brought our 2 childrens to KMC on 14/04/2022 around 9pm. Since both are symptomatic, RTK test had to be done first. Yeah, my daughter is positive after a very long wait.

1st failed service : RTK test that took more than 1 hour to do and get result (a small clinic at pekan kepala batas, Alor Setar can do a better, super fast RTK test and result).

2nd failed service : very very poor communication to a customer/patient on what to do and what to expect on the service flow. No clear direction and procedure, at least to those working on 14/04 evening.

3rd failed service : KMC is a private hospital. We were being told that not enough doctor to handle patient at that time. How come???

We finally managed to settle everything close to 1am, 15th April 2022.
Private hospital huh?

Buck up KMC!!!"

I feel that they are able to assist you with almost all your complications. Best part is that, if they aren't equipped to, they will go out of their way to offer solutions, recommend contacts just to help you out.

Their team is driven, and I must thank Mohammad, for all his help. Never failing to attend to the community of Langkawi, as they are always on standby to aid.

If you're on the island, and have experience falling ill, food poisoning, gastric, or of any kind of illness, I would suggest you to head to this clinic to get yourself checked first.

It is located inside the vicinity of Pelangi Beach Resort, Langkawi.

That's all from your island gurl,

When I first came to see Dr. Wee, I was desperate and mentally exhausted. All I wanted was just to seek for some help from medicine, because I could no longer consume any verbal consultancy. But one real consultation session was far from what I had imagined. It was not purely a ‚Äúquestions and answers‚Äù meeting followed by some textbook advices. He attentively listened to everything I told no matter how emotional I was and how stupid my stories were, then would help me analyse the causes of my condition. It‚Äôs not easy to talk about your problems in front of a stranger, but trust me, Dr. Wee is different. He was so kind and patient that there were times I felt he was like a parent, a family member, someone from whom I was unable to hide my depressed soul üò¢. The first session with doctor helped me understand thoroughly many things, I felt that some heavy rocks in my heart were lifted up.
About medication: he would prescribe a small amount of drugs for the first period of time to see their effects on your body, and would switch to other drugs, so that the medication bring you the least side effects.
My personal thoughts on the medication, anti-depressant, specifically: it really helps in controlling my mood and depressive episodes, but cannot be the only solution for depression.
Have stopped seeing him already but still remember his advice ‚Äúdo exercise everyday‚Äù. Yes, I‚Äôm doing. And sleeping very well."

First met dr wee was about two years ago. Before meeting him, I have seen more than five psychiatrists, some of them are very famous in Malaysia. Why non stop changing psychiatrists?Yea, my bad, I got a really high expectation.No comments on their professionalism, but I couldn't find any connections with them. The biggest difference between Dr wee and other psychiatrists is, Dr wee is used to describe the action and reaction of the drugs and their side effects to us. At the same time, keep on trying out the best and most suitable medication so that it won't cause too much burden to our body. We able to discuss anything, like the selection of medications, dosage adjustment, etc. In addition, he is a really great listener, always on the fence, no simply judgement, provides the most professional advice. Words to describe him?Caring, kind and professional!He is really into his job, the best doctor ever.Ps, other than psychiatry consultation, he does provide hypnosis, psychotherapy & counseling.Last but not least,
well-known is not necessarily the best, the right one is the best! Stop struggling, only one step away!

Words are powerless to express my gratitude.Thanks for everything!"
